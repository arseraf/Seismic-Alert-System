# **Seismic Alert System**

## Project Objetives:
    - Create a database containing data of the three countries regarding seismic activity, it's magnitude, location, casualties, damage and tsunami ocurrency.
    
    - Identify areas with high-magnitude seismic risk and potential widespread destruction in order to focus on earthquake prevention investments.

    - Analyze earthquake resistance improvement over time (casualties, building damage, emergency services effectiveness).

    - Predict high-magnitude seismic replicas, tsunamis, volcano eruptions after a mayor earthquake. 
    
    - Implement an alert and comunication system for civil population based on the predictions.
    
    - Analyze the earthquake social impact via social media


## KPIs:
    - Average casualties over time
    - Earthquake occurency over time
    - Earthquake magnitude over time
    - Economic loss evolution
    - Investment to mitigate earthquake effects over time
